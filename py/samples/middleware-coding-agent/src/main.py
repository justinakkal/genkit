"""Agentic coding REPL — Filesystem + Skills + ToolApproval middleware.

An interactive coding agent that reads, edits, and writes files inside a
sandboxed ``workspace/`` directory. Read-only tools (``read_file``,
``list_files``, ``use_skill``) run automatically; everything that can
mutate the workspace (``write_file``, ``edit_file``) is gated by
``ToolApproval``, so the CLI pauses and asks ``y/N`` before each write.

The agent state — middleware instances, message history, the
read-before-write cache inside ``Filesystem`` — is owned by a
``CodingAgent`` session object built once per ``main()`` invocation.
That ties every ``ai.generate()`` and resume in this REPL to one shared
``Filesystem`` instance, so a read in one turn satisfies the guard for a
write in the next turn (including writes that come back through a
``ToolApproval`` interrupt + resume).

Re-running cleanly:

* The agent mutates files in ``workspace/`` directly. To start over,
  ``rm -rf workspace/*`` — the directory itself is recreated on next run.
